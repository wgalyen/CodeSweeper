- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) projects
- [Unity](https://unity.com/) Projects
- [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) projects
- [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/) projects
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) projects
- [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) projects

## Operation

### Graphic User Interface

Launch `codesweeper-ui`, select a directory to be scanned, evaluate & clean directories as needed.

### Command Line Interface

## Example Output

## Building/Development

To build `codesweeper` you can run `cargo build` from the projects root directory.

To build `codesweeper-ui` you must first navigate into the `codesweeper-ui` directory, then you can run `cargo build`. Because we use [druid](https://github.com/xi-editor/druid) for the interface you'll need to satisfy druid's [platform specific dependencies](https://github.com/xi-editor/druid#platform-notes).
