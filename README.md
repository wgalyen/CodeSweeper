# CodeSweeper ðŸ§¹

Cleans unneeded directories and files from your system.

It will identify the disk space savings you would get from deleting temporary/unnecessary files from project directories, such as `target` from Cargo projects and `node_modules` from Node projects. Currently `codesweeper` doesn't actually delete any files.

Supports:

- Cargo projects
- Node projects
- Unity Projects
- Haskell Stack projects

## Roadmap

- Actually delete (with prompt)
- Handle Unity cache, editor cache

## Operation

Running `codesweeper` without a directory specified will run in the current directory.

```
$ codesweeper
```

Supplying an argument will tell `codesweeper` where to start.

```
$ codesweeper code/my_project
```

## Example Output

```
$ codesweeper ~
